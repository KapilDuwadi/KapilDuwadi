### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Hope you are having good time surfing the Internet :smiley:

I am currently a Research Enginner at [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](www.nrel.gov). I mostly work on developing research softwares
helping power distribution utilities as well as university researchers understand interaction between power grid and grid edge technologies. 
[Visit my website](www.kduwadi.com) if you are interested in learning about the projects I am involved in. Below is a list of projects I am currently working and/or maintaing.


### :rocket: [PRECISE](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/precise-tool.html)
---

PRECISE is a software tool developed for the purpose of assessing roof top solar interconnection application for distribution utility. Currently PRECISE is in production at SMUD processing tens of applications each day. 

### :rocket: [SHIFT](www.github.com/nrel/shift)
---

SHIFT is a synthetic feeder generation tool which levergaes open street data such as buildings and road network to build detailed synthetic feeder models. It is currently incorporates distribution system design principles for India and Nepal. So if you are looking for some synthetic feeders for south asian countries this is the right tool.

### :rocket: [EMERGE](www.github.com/nrel/emerge)
---

EMERGE is a distribution system explorer tool. Use this tool to quickly analyze your feeders. You can look at metrics for both snapshot and time series powerflow analysis.

### :rocket: [EVOLVE](www.github.com/nrel/evolve)
---

EVOLVE is a simple dashboard solution for analyzing net load profile at different level of distribution systems under the influence of solar, energy storage and electric vehicle.

### :rocket: [REEDS Web App](https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/reeds/)
---

REEDS Web app allows users to run capacity planning model from thw web browser.
